# FakeShark
A music-streaming service / [Grooveshark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grooveshark) tribute built enitrely in Javascript
- Live at [fakeshark.meteor.com](http://fakeshark.meteor.com/) 
- Creating an account will allow you to upload songs (please only use mp3s for right now!), view that chat, and add you to the leaderboard
- Currently, the 'Add to playlist' option will only work when the 'Download' link appears. When adding a new song hover over the 'Download' link. When it appears to be clickable, you can then add the song to the playlist
